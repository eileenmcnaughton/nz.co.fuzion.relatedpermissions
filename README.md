nz.co.fuzion.relatedpermissions
===============================

Empowers inherited permissions throughout Civi. Note that the latest version allows you to specify that certain relationships
should always be permissioned BUT it is dependent on  https://github.com/eileenmcnaughton/nz.co.fuzion.entitysetting

Because of the dependency the later version is not available for automated download
You also need this commit (in 4.4.6)
